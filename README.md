# Packt_Publishing_file_renaming_program
Renames the goofy filenames (34567890121-nameof book.pdf) and its code file to remove the number and use the book name on the code file (zip).   The program is dangerous as if you run it twice on the same name it will lop off the appropriate numbers of characters as if the numbers were still there.    If you download programs from Packt Publishing, you will find this very useful to take the filename and code file lop of the numbers, drop the caps, and give the code file the name bookname-code.zip.  Will do a full directory at a time.  It only works for pdf files and code.zip files (easily changed in the source)
